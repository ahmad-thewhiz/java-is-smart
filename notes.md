- static: is a keyword that means the method belongs to the class and not any object of the class.
    * method: It is a function defined inside a class that performs an action.

### @ symbol
- The @ symbol is used for annotations in Java.

### Java Naming Conventions

- Method names should start with a lowercase letter. (camelCase)

### Features of Java
1. Secure - HVM has a securer / verifier
2. Platform Independent - Write once, run anywhere
3. Object-Oriented - Everything is an object
4. Supports Multithreading
5. Architecture Neutral - Independent of the hardware architectures like Van Neumann, ARM, etc.
6. Supports Distributed Computing - RMI, EJB, etc.

### Merging and Masking
- Merging: Combining two numbers by using the bitwise OR operator.
- Masking: Using a mask to select a specific set of bits from a number.
- Swapping: Exchange the values of two variables without using a third variable.XOR operator is used to swap two numbers. compute a=a^b, b=a^b, a=a^b 

### Widening and Narrowing
- Widening: Converting a smaller data type to a larger data type.
- Narrowing: Converting a larger data type to a smaller data type.
