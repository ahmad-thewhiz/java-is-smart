A ThreadPool is a collection of pre-created threads that can be reused for executing tasks. Instead of creating a new thread for every task, which can be resource-intensive and slow, a thread pool allows tasks to be submitted for execution, and the threads in the pool execute them.

Benefits of a ThreadPool:
- Efficient Resource Management: Limits the number of threads, preventing overuse of system resources.
- Improved Performance: Reuses threads, reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
- Controlled Concurrency: Ensures a fixed number of threads are active, avoiding issues like thread starvation or system crashes.
